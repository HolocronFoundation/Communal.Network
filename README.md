# Communal.Network

Communal.Network is a Modular Medium Distributed Distribution Secure System (MMDDSS), originally developed by The Holocron.Foundation.

**Modular:** The Holocron.Foundation designed Communal.Network to be modular via two pathways: a "channel" system and an "extension" system:
* **Channels:** Anyone can claim a channel, and then define how the channel functions - what content the channel distributes, how the UI displays content, who or what can add content to a channel, what governance mechanisms a channel employs...
* **Extensions:** TODO

**Medium:** TODO

**Distributed:** The Holocron.Foundation placed Communal.Network on the Ethereum blockchain; the Ethereum blockchain distributes the Communal.Network via thousands of computers, located globally, each containing a backup of Communal.Network, in a P2P manner. This global P2P distribution provides censorship-resistance to the network.

**Distribution:** TODO

**Secure:** The Ethereum blockchain provides three key pieces of security to Communal.Network:
* **Personal info/password security:** You are *never* required to send a password, email address, name, or other piece of information to the network.
* **Spam-resistance:** Due to the costs of transacting using Ethereum, this discourages spam by putting the cost to interact with the network on the spammer, rather than on the server-runner.
* **Auditable:** You can audit the open source code.

**System:** Communal.Network consists of a primary back-end, front-end, and file distribution working in tandem and requiring no maintenance:
* **Back-end:** Communal.Network's primary back-end is the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain contains the basic configuration information, files, hashes, and logic which run and distribute Communal.Network. The Holocron.Foundation has coded the back-end in Vyper.
* **Front-end:** The Holocron.Foundation build the primary front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a traditional front-end web stack. This front-end displays user content and allows users to distribute content.
* **File-distribution:** Users can store files using IPFS and distribute the hashes of those files via the Ethereum back-end. Users can post content via IPFS directly in their browser, or post files to IPFS and later distribute the hashes via Communal.Network.

Communal.Network is open source, and The Holocron.Foundation has licensed the code under the CC0 license - effectively, the code is in the public domain. The Holocron.Foundation appreciates contributions to the Communal.Network code-base!
