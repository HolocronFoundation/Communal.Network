# Communal.Network

Communal.Network is an open source and public domain social media and, more generally, file distribution site running on the Ethereum network.

There are three aspects of the above which provide key benefits: being open source, being in the public domain, and running on Ethereum. *See benefits*.

The network is designed to be highly flexible, modular, and open. You could combine our network with custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript to run your own social networking site with your own features. You could create additional Ethereum code to build additional on-chain features as well and call a combination of our code and yours through custom web code (though we hope we've made the design sufficiently flexible that this will not be needed in most use cases).

## Benefits

### Open source benefits

Being open source allows you to see and audit every aspect of how our network runs. You can see exactly what data is retained. We aren't collecting extraneous information needed beyond the bare minimum to run the features included.

We also accept contributions to improve out network - which requires the availability of our source code.

### Ethereum benefits

Communal.Network is secure. There are no human points of failure, our code can be audited, and we never even touch a password or email of yours.

Communal.Network is censor-resistant. This is due to the immutable nature of the blockchain, and the P2P ability to transact on the network.

Communal.Network is spam-resistant. Due to the costs of transacting using Ethereum, this discourages spam by putting the cost to interact with the network on the spammer, rather than on the server-runner.

Communal.Network is global. *See* https://www.ethernodes.org/network/1

Communal.Network is decentralized.

Communal.Network will run as long as Ethereum does.

### Public domain benefits

If you do not like how the network is being run, you can create your own version using our code.
